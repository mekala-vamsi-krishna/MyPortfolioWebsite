          <h2>Who are you?</h2>
          <p>
            I am an iOS Developer right now. I have learnt Swift and SwiftUI.
            I have  built many iOS basic apps in the learning process. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I am studying in BHARATH INSTITUTE of HIGHER EDUCATION and REASEARCH - BIHER.
            I have started studying B.Tech in the year 2020, Which was lockdown period. In that 
            lockdown period I have learnt so many new things regarding computer. They are HTML, CSS, C - Programming Language, Swift - iOS Development, MySQL - DBMS.

          <h2>Why I have chosen, iOS Development as my career?</h2>
          <p>
            The first inspiration is my uncle - mamayya, Ravi Krishna. He inspired 
            me a lot and lot. At first, it became difficult for me to learn iOS development.
            Slowly, He pushed me into the getting interset of building an iOS apps.
          </p>
          <p>
            But, I will say onething. I am not pro iOS Developer. I used to say that I am a completely leaner of my whole life. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I have seen a lot of struggles in my life. But, I believe that my struggles are very much less as compared to my father's - Mekala Mohana Rao struggle.
